# Stock-Price-Prediction
Predict the price of particular stock by using different algorithms of Machine Learning  

## Approach

1.Here, we have taken the date data from 1 January,2016 to 31 July,2016 into a multidimension array X and considered that as a parameter for dependency of stock in market.  
2.We have taken another 1-D matrix Y to store corresponding price  
3.Through these, we have used linear regression to predict their corresponding dependency amount for stock.  
4.Then we feed the data for the next five months and find corresponding predicted price.  
5.We also found the error percentage there.  
6.Then we take a date and find its predicted price.
